This repository contains my attempts to solve the [advent of code challenges](www.adventofcode.com) in haskell. As I am not very familiar with the language, experienced users may cringe :)

However, feedback is always appreciated!

I try to write my solutions so that you can simply pipe the input into the file, i.e. by running ``$ runhaskell 1.hs < 1.in``
